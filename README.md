# Wedding Planner
## Coding Dojo's C# Wedding Planner Assignment

## Objectives
```
* Connect a Login/Registration to application that depends on a logged-in user
* Get practice building out your own database from wireframe
* Continued practice with many-to-many SQL tables/Entity Framework models (hint: this app will necessitate many-to-manys!)
* Create a web app that allows registered users to plan a wedding. Users can RSVP to weddings and view attendee lists.

* From assignment wireframe, build the necessary SQL tables
* Build out app, implementing features displayed in wireframe
* (Optional) Weddings expire when the scheduled date passes, and are removed from the database.
